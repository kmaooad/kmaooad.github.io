## Assignments
 
| # | Assignment | Deadline |   |
| ---- | ---- | ----- | --- |
| 1 | ["Login Sessions"](https://classroom.github.com/g/0-o9B6yk) | Oct 27 |  |


### Getting assignments

1. Create your personal GitHub account (if you don't have one)
2. Login to GitHub and follow one of the assigment links above
3. On your first opening some assignment, GitHub will request access from Classroom to your account — that's ok, just grant access.
   a. For group assignments you'll have to either create a team or join an existing one
4. As you accept the assignment, GitHub will create a private repository and put starter code for assignment there.
5. Use created repository from the previous step to push code of your solution for assignment.


## Using F# 

The quickest way to get into F# (having knowledge of programming in other languages) is to follow cool tutorial at [try.fsharp.org](https://try.fsharp.org). 

There is also a nice [F# Cheatsheet](https://dungpa.github.io/fsharp-cheatsheet/) with almost all available language features and syntax highlights. 

Finally, offical [F# documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/) is well-written and more than enough for the needs of our course. 

Remember, we are not learning language itself here, but only use it as a convenient tool for learning software design. So please feel free to ask questions in Gitter if you feel any discomfort about F#. 

## Reading & more info

There is no such thing as "The Design Book", no book or even several books exist that could be a substitute for this course or exhaustive body of knowledge on the topic. Yet there are good books - some really considered *classics* today – and they can help to build *initial* body of knowledge. Some of the mentioned books are refered during the course.

**Good general books about principles, patterns, and methods**

[Ddd] Eric Evans, "Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software"

[GoF] Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson, and Richard Helm, "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"

[Fow] Martin Fowler, "Patterns of Enterprise Applications Architecture" ([book website](https://www.martinfowler.com/books/eaa.html), [patterns catalog](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/))

[See] Mark Seemann, "Dependency Injection in .NET, Second Edition"

[Lar] Craig Larman, "Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and Iterative Development (3rd Edition)"

[Mar] Robert C. Martin, "Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#"

[Ver] Vaugn Vernon, "Implementing Domain-Driven Design"

**Some advanced/ad-hoc sources, including architecture and technology**

[blog.ploeh.dk](https://blog.ploeh.dk) Mark Seemann blog. Advanced reading, not easy, addresses tricky issues and advanced topics. Highly recommended.

"CQRS Journey: Exploring CQRS and Event Sourcing" (by Microsoft team) [website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/msp-n-p/jj554200(v=pandp.10)) 

Gregor Hohpe, Bobby Woolf, "Enterprise Integration Patterns : Designing, Building, and Deploying Messaging Solutions" ([book website](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/) with additional info)

[eShopOnWeb](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnWeb) – cool sample application from Microsoft showcasing typical usage of EF Core, ASP.NET Core, patterns etc]

[eShopOnContainers](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers) – similar to above, but much more advanced version: with microservices, containers, message bus etc.
